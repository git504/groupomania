## What is PERN Stack?

This stack consists of **PostgreSQL, Express, React and Node.js**.

Combining these techs, one can build a full-stack web application with **CRUD** operations.

## Set up directory

The **Client** directory contains the React code.

The **Server** directory contains the code for the node.js express server.


cd into both Project Directories in 2 different terminal windows and then install the dependencies

#### 1st window

    cd Client
    npm install

#### 2nd window

    cd Server
    npm install

## Run both the server and client at the same time

#### 1st window

    npm start
    *** runs react at localhost:3000 ***

#### 2nd window

    npm run devstart
    *** devstart runs nodemon at localhost:5000 ***
