## What is PERN Stack?

This stack consists of **MySQL || Postgres, Express, React and Node.js**.

Combining these techs, one can build a full-stack web app with **CRUD** operations on a **MVC** model-view-controller architecture.

## ☑️ To sum up :

- React front-end
- **RESTful API** with Node & Express, MySQL & Sequelize

## **⏩** Set up directory

The **client** directory contains the React code.

The **server** directory contains the code for the node.js express server.

`cd` into both Project Directories in 2 different terminal windows and then install the dependencies.

#### 1st window

    cd client
    npm install

#### 2nd window

    cd server
    npm install

## 💻 Run both the server and client at the same time

#### 1st window

    npm start
    *** runs react at localhost:3000 ***

#### 2nd window

    npm run devStart
    *** devStart runs nodemon at localhost:3001 ***

then connect your **SQL** database with `server/config/config.js`
